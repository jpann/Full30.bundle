# Full30.bundle

This is an unoffical Plex channel that lets you watch Full30.com videos on any device that supports Plex. This project is my first try at a Plex channel and is a work in progress, which is likely full of issues. Currently it does not stream videos in HD.

This is in no way associated with Full30.com.

## Features
- Stream videos from all channels on Full30.com.
- View videos by channel's featured videos list.
- View videos by channel's recent videos list.
